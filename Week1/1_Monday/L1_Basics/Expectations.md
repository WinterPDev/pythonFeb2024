### Write Code More Than You Read Or Watch About Code!

---------------------------

Note: These are ideals, but if you fall behind that's okay! Communicate and seek help from your Cohort/Instructor/TA; Don't suffer in silence!

1. The course will go fast in Week 2, so take advantage of Week 1 to take your time and really grasp the language/avoid falling behind on the Core assignments.

---------------------------

2. Avoid falling behind more than 1 Core assignment! 
    - If you fall behind by more than 1 day, please reach out to get unstuck if needed! 

---------------------------

3. Academic Probation (AP) checks are every Monday, the expectation is being up to 90% complete for that week before Monday. 
    So use the weekends as a safety net/buffer if you need to! 

---------------------------

4. The recommended learning flow:
    - Read the learn platform material/Attempt assignments before lecture. Note any questions/errors and bring those to discuss in lectures.
    - Attend the lecture. The lecture is to explore new concepts in more depth/address barriers in a group setting. But they are not a replacement for the learn platform!
    - Work on core/practice assignments between lectures, bring questions/errors/etc. to afternoon lecture.

---------------------------

5. Ahead in the assignments? Help your cohort-mates!
    If you are ahead 1 or more assignments, I suggest going to the relevant core assignment break-out rooms and let people know you're free to help if they need it! 
    One of the best things you can do for yourself as a developer is learn to teach, as well as reinforce concepts by helping/explaining to others. (It's also great to get rid of imposter syndrome!)
